"""Fail if a `__LIKE_THIS__` template placeholder is still unsubstituted.

Every value in this repo that must be unique per generated tenant repo is
committed as a `__SOME_NAME__` placeholder, meant to be substituted by the
provisioning script when the repo is generated from the tenant template. The
files carrying such placeholders are listed in DEFAULT_FILES below.

Two remain. `__TENANT_NAME__` is validated downstream -- the `--stack` flag
errors with "stack not found". The Pulumi *project* name in Pulumi.yaml is
not: nothing sends it to a GCP API, and Pulumi's own project-name grammar
(alphanumerics, hyphens, underscores, periods) accepts the placeholder text
unchanged, so an unsubstituted one produces a valid-looking state object path
under a name no human chose. Each tenant now has its own state bucket, so the
old cross-tenant collision is gone; what is left is a stack filed under a
name nobody will recognise at restore time.

Run as a CI preflight, before anything is applied -- the type-check job
(can't be skipped by an operator following the runbook) and the deploy
job's delete-guard preflight (the last gate before `pulumi up`) both call
this.

Usage:
    assert-placeholders-substituted.py [file ...]

With no arguments, checks every file in DEFAULT_FILES.
Exit status 0 if no placeholder remains, 1 if one does.
