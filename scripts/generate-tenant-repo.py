"""Turn a fresh clone of a template-generated repo into one tenant's repo.

Run by the platform's provisioning flow, from the root of the clone, once:

    generate-tenant-repo.py --slug blog

It removes what belongs to the template and not to a tenant, substitutes every
`__LIKE_THIS__` placeholder, renames the tenant-facing README over the
template-facing one, and then refuses if any placeholder survives anywhere.

**It lives here rather than in the provisioning workflow on purpose.** What a
tenant repo should and should not contain is a property of the template — a
copy of that knowledge in another repository's workflow goes stale the first
time a file is added here. The failure is silent and it propagates.

**Removal is not tidiness; it is what makes a generated repo's CI pass.** The
template's own test suite asserts template-only facts — that `README.tenant.md`
exists, that `Pulumi.yaml` still carries an unsubstituted placeholder — and both
jobs in the generated `infra-ci.yml` run `unittest discover -s scripts`. Left in
place, every tenant repo fails its own type-check job from birth, `deploy` never
runs because it `needs: [typecheck]`, and no tenant ever deploys.

Order matters, and it is the reverse of the obvious one. The rename runs
**last**: a failure after it would leave `README.tenant.md` gone and a re-run
would die naming the wrong cause. Removals are idempotent, so everything before
the rename is safe to re-run.

Exit 0 on success, 1 on any refusal, 2 on usage error.

# becomes a Compose project, a systemd instance name, a directory, a MySQL
# identifier and two volume names, so a value valid in one and not another is a
# tenant that provisions and then cannot start. The trailing character is
# restricted to a letter or digit for the same reason it is on the component's
# side: the slug also becomes an S3-compatible media bucket name, and bucket
# naming rules require a bucket name to both start and end with one.
# `branchLeft/workspace#681` found this copy had drifted to accept a trailing
# hyphen; `test_charset_matches_the_installed_component_across_a_battery`
# below now runs a full battery of boundary slugs through the installed

# `test_bounds_match_the_installed_component` alone compared, so a future
