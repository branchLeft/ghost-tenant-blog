"""Fail if a `pulumi preview --json` plan would destroy protected infrastructure.

The plan-matching logic (`destructive_steps`) mirrors
`branchLeft/ghost-platform`'s `infra/platform/scripts/assert-no-platform-deletes.py`
(same Pulumi CLI, same `--json` output shape). What differs is *which*
resources matter: `PROTECTED`, the coverage check, and the fixtures.

Run as a preflight inside the CI deploy job, against the same stack state
`pulumi up` is about to act on, a few seconds earlier. A pass is therefore a
real statement about that run -- but see "What this cannot prove" below.

Usage:
    assert-no-tenant-deletes.py <preview-json-file>
    assert-no-tenant-deletes.py --self-test
    assert-no-tenant-deletes.py --verify-coverage <package-dist-dir>

Exit status 0 if clean, 1 if a protected resource would be destroyed (or if
any input could not be read or understood), 2 on usage error.

Why this can't just reuse `PROTECTED` from the sibling script: this
program's resources aren't declared with fixed, literal Pulumi logical names
the way the platform stack's are. `GhostTenant` (`@branchleft/ghost-platform-tenant`)
builds each child resource's name as `${tenantName}-<suffix>` from stack
config, so what a real preview reports exists as a literal string nowhere in
source -- only synthesised at runtime. See `_declaration_pattern_tenant_suffix`
below for how coverage-verification adapts to that; `PROTECTED` itself still
needs full names to match real URNs, built from `_TENANT_NAME` (see below).

**Onboarding a second tenant using this same stack name must update this
file** if the tenant name ever changes post-provisioning -- `PROTECTED`'s
tenant-derived entries are literal, not computed at run time, the same
"add it, review it, merge it -- never let CI infer it" pattern this
programme uses for IAM roles.

What this cannot prove -- same two limits as the platform script:

1. `pulumi preview` compares the program to Pulumi *state*, never to live
   GCP. A resource already deleted out-of-band still shows as unchanged
   here. This answers "will this apply destroy something", not "is the
   tenant's infrastructure intact".

2. A rename carrying Pulumi's `aliases` resource option produces an in-place
   update with no destructive step at all, so the plan check reports clean
   while silently retiring the old logical name. `--verify-coverage` is what
   closes that.

Coverage-verification reads the *installed package*, not this repo's source.
Every name in `PROTECTED` is a `GhostTenant` child, and this program declares
no protected resource of its own -- so the question the check has to answer is
"does the pinned `@branchleft/ghost-platform-tenant` still name these
resources the way `PROTECTED` assumes", which is exactly what a version bump
changes.

    # Deliberately absent, with reasoning:
    #
    # - This repo's CI identity. It is no longer declared here at all: the
    #   deployer service account, the Workload Identity pool and provider and
    #   the impersonation binding are created by the platform's provisioning
    #   flow and live in its state, so no plan produced in this repo can
    #   destroy them. The guard against destroying them belongs to whatever
    #   applies them, and duplicating the names here would guard nothing while
    #   reading as though it did.
    #
    # - The Secret Manager entries (db username, db password, HMAC access
    #   key ID, HMAC secret access key). Each is cheap to regenerate: the
    #   credential it stores already lives in Pulumi state independent of
    #   the Secret Manager resource, so losing the secret and re-applying
    #   recreates it with no data loss -- unlike the SA, DB user, or HMAC
    #   key itself, none of which self-heal.
    # - The conditional IAMMember bindings (cloudsql-client, media-create,
    #   media-read). CI holds no permission to change any of these anyway
    #   (serviceAccounts.ts grants no setIamPolicy and no bucket-scoped
    #   storage role), so guarding them here would add a second, more
    #   confusing failure on top of a 403 that already stops the run.
    # - The DB password (a random.RandomPassword). Generated locally, calls
    #   no GCP API, and a "delete" step against it is pure Pulumi
    #   bookkeeping with nothing live to lose.
